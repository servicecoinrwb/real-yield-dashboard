ðŸ§© Service Kernel Framework 
Overview
The Service Kernel Framework is a modular smart contract system on Arbitrum that enables DAO-controlled capital deployment and yield routing. Itâ€™s designed for real-world coordination, bot automation, and investor yield distribution â€” all without requiring overcollateralization.

ðŸ”§ Core Modules
1. KernelSmartAccount
DAO-owned
Disburses funds to a solver (bot/agent)
Tracks principal deployment + repayments
2. YieldVault
Accepts fees from the Kernel
Sends yield to DAO treasury
Tracks accumulated fees
3. InvestorVault
External users can deposit USDC
Capital routed to solver
Yield + principal returned over time




4. CamelotTradeBot
Volume simulator (or real trading bot)
Generates yield from LP arbitrage
Pipes income to YieldVault

ðŸ’¡ Use Cases
Seasonal working capital for HVAC or service businesses
On-chain lending to trusted contractors
Simulated CoW Swap volume routing yield to DAO
Investor vaults for community-backed lending pools

ðŸ’¸ Value to Arbitrum
Composable middleware for DAO finance
Native USDC usage on Arbitrum
Real-world DeFi utility with smart contract enforcement
Easily forkable framework for RWA protocols

âœ… Summary
The Service Kernel Framework turns DAOs into automated capital engines â€” funding bots, contractors, and yield flows in a secure, permissionless, and programmable way. Ideal for any DAO working with real-world revenue or DeFi capital.
