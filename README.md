üß© Service Kernel Framework Overview
The Service Kernel Framework is a modular smart contract system on Arbitrum that enables DAO-controlled capital deployment and yield routing. It‚Äôs designed for real-world coordination, bot automation, and investor yield distribution ‚Äî all without requiring overcollateralization.

üîß Core Modules
KernelSmartAccount: DAO-owned. Disburses funds to a solver (bot/agent). Tracks principal deployment and repayments.

YieldVault: Accepts fees from the Kernel. Sends yield to the DAO treasury. Tracks accumulated fees.

InvestorVault: External users can deposit USDC. Capital is routed to the solver. Yield and principal are returned over time.

CamelotTradeBot: A volume simulator (or a real trading bot) that generates yield from LP arbitrage and pipes income to the YieldVault.

üí° Use Cases
Seasonal working capital for HVAC or service businesses.

On-chain lending to trusted contractors.

Simulated CoW Swap volume routing yield to the DAO.

Investor vaults for community-backed lending pools.

üí∏ Value to Arbitrum
Composable middleware for DAO finance.

Native USDC usage on Arbitrum.

Real-world DeFi utility with smart contract enforcement.

Easily forkable framework for RWA protocols.

‚úÖ Summary
The Service Kernel Framework turns DAOs into automated capital engines ‚Äî funding bots, contractors, and yield flows in a secure, permissionless, and programmable way. It is ideal for any DAO working with real-world revenue or DeFi capital.
