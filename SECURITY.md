# Security Policy

The team behind the Service Kernel Framework takes the security of our smart contracts and the funds of our users extremely seriously. We welcome and value contributions from security researchers to help ensure the safety of our ecosystem.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you believe you have discovered a security vulnerability in our protocol, please report it to us through one of the following methods.

**We strongly prefer reports via GitHub's Private Vulnerability Reporting feature.** This ensures the report is triaged and addressed securely.

1.  **Primary Method:** Navigate to the "Security" tab of our repository and click "Report a vulnerability."
2.  **Secondary Method:** If you are unable to use the primary method, please email us at **[info@service.money]**.

**Please do not report vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues or other public channels.**

### What to Include in a Report

To help us triage and resolve the issue faster, please include the following in your report:

* A clear description of the vulnerability.
* The specific smart contracts or code sections affected.
* The potential impact of the vulnerability.
* Detailed steps to reproduce the issue, including any required setup or transaction data.

### Our Commitment

If you report a vulnerability in good faith, we commit to:

* Acknowledging receipt of your report in a timely manner.
* Providing you with updates on our progress as we investigate and remediate the issue.
* Working with you to understand and resolve the issue.
* Offering a reward through our bug bounty program for valid, impactful vulnerabilities.

## Bug Bounty Program

We are formalizing a bug bounty program to reward researchers for their contributions. For the most current details on scope and potential rewards, please see the **[[Security]]** page on our official wiki.

## Scope

This policy applies to the smart contracts and frontend code contained within the `servicecoinrwb/real-yield-dashboard` repository. Please do not report issues related to third-party services or dependencies unless you can demonstrate a specific vulnerability within our implementation.
